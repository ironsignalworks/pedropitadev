Pedro Pita — Creative Technologist & Web Developer
Lisbon, PT · Remote OK

I build fast, quiet interfaces and interactive web experiences at the intersection of code, design, and storytelling.

👤 About / Bio

I’m a creative technologist and web developer with a background spanning data analytics, front-end development, and media production. I turn complex ideas into clear, functional interfaces — from data dashboards to experimental web games.

Skilled in JavaScript (React, Node.js, Vite), SQL, Power BI, and the Adobe Creative Suite, I combine technical precision with visual direction and a hands-on understanding of systems, UX, and audio design.

I also work in soundtrack and synth production, building adaptive audio for games and experimental web experiences using DAWs (Ableton Live, Reaper) and custom sound design pipelines.

Iron Signal Works — open prototypes and browser-based experiments.

Catastrophic Labs — experimental release studio for games, soundtracks, and interactive media.

Mojobyte — client-facing web development studio focused on custom apps, design systems, and managed hosting (currently rebranding).
