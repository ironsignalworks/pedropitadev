The Best Flow (used by itch.io, Steam Deck, and top interactive portfolios)
1️⃣ Start with a game card

Each game should appear as a poster-style card — cinematic but compact:

Poster key art or cropped title image

Overlay gradient (bottom 30%)

Title + tagline text

A small ▶️ “Play” button or “View Game” badge at the bottom corner

This gives your brand consistency (Catastrophic Labs poster art) and makes each game easily recognizable even at small sizes.

Why poster instead of gameplay?
Posters trigger emotion and establish brand identity. Gameplay comes next in the modal. Posters are easier to standardize and load quickly on mobile.

2️⃣ Tap → open full-screen modal / drawer

Modal Layout (mobile-first):

Header bar: title + close ✕

Hero area: auto-playing short gameplay loop (muted, 6–10s) or still thumbnail

Below: “Play / Launch Game” button (CTA)

Optional tabs: About • Screens • Controls

Gesture tip: allow swipe-down to close the modal (mimics mobile drawers).

3️⃣ Inside the modal

Structure like this:

[ video / gif / screenshot ]
[ Play Game Button ]
[ Short description (1–2 lines) ]
[ Tags: #Arcade #Roguelike #Prototype ]
[ 1–3 screenshots in swipe carousel ]
[ Devlog / Press Kit / Learn more ]


Keep all text readable with fingers — 16–18px base minimum.

4️⃣ If the game runs inline

When the user taps Play, you can either:

Replace the modal with a fullscreen <iframe> or canvas (if it’s lightweight),

Or open a dedicated “Play” page (better for heavy WebGL builds).

Add a clear back/close button in the corner — visible on mobile overlay.

🖼️ Visual hierarchy that works
Layer	Visual	UX purpose
Card (thumbnail)	Poster key art or static GIF	Establish identity, invite tap
Modal hero	Looping gameplay GIF/video	Prove it’s playable, grab attention
CTA	“Play Game” button	Single clear action
Body	Short text, tags, screenshots	Context + social proof
Footer	“Press Kit / Devlog / Website”	Extra info for curious visitors
🧠 Extra details that make it feel polished

Preload small WebP posters; lazy-load gameplay GIF/MP4 inside modal.

Use a blurred or tinted poster as modal background — adds immersion.

Add haptic feedback (CSS :active + vibration if available).

Modal animation:

Fade-in + scale-up (100 → 104%)

Swipe-down to close on touch devices.

🎨 Recommended visual mix (for you specifically)
Brand	Entry Visual	Modal Hero
Iron Signal Works	Glitchy poster with ANSI logo	Short gameplay loop with CRT overlay
Catastrophic Labs	Cinematic poster	16:9 gameplay trailer snippet
NovaScript / MojoByte	Clean frame, static logo	Static screenshot / animation of UI

This way, the user always taps on “art” — not a random gameplay freeze — and when the modal opens, the world comes alive.

TL;DR

✅ Start with poster / key art card (not raw gameplay)
✅ Tap opens a full-screen modal with a short gameplay loop, title, and “Play Game” CTA
✅ Keep text minimal, big, and tappable
✅ Use blurred poster as modal background
✅ Optional: swipe-down to close + gentle scale animation
